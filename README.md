## 👋 About Me

I design and deploy AI-enabled edge systems under real-world hardware constraints.

My focus is not isolated model performance,  
but **system-level engineering decisions** across:

- Edge AI inference
- Embedded Linux deployment
- Secure device-to-device communication
- Scalable IoT data pipelines
- Hardware-aware trade-off analysis
